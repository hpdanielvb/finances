The trajectory details the transition of the OrçaZenFinanceiro project from a previous AI engineer to the current one. The former successfully built the MVP, tackling critical bugs like login, currency formatting, and account deletion, and implemented core features including hierarchical categories with AI classification, an AI module, and a Consortium module. The project was declared 100% functional after the category system.

Upon handover, the user assigned new priorities: a comprehensive reporting system, dashboard enhancements, and credit card invoice automation, along with additional requests like a tag system. The current engineer initiated backend development by adding new report endpoints, credit card invoice management, and transaction tags. Debugging was iterative, addressing issues like Excel export, credit card payment, and MongoDB ObjectId serialization errors. Frontend development followed, integrating these features into the  and , including a new  and dashboard enhancements.

A critical turn occurred when the user reported persistent errors in previously fixed functionalities, explicitly stating these re-fixes should not consume additional credits. The current engineer immediately pivoted to investigate, starting with the , confirming its incomplete implementation despite prior claims of functionality. This is the current focus, prioritizing bug fixes without additional credit usage before proceeding with new feature implementation.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture:


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: Central API logic, database interactions (MongoDB), and business logic for all application modules (accounts, transactions, budgets, goals, AI, consortiums).
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Existing: Account deletion fix (remove associated transactions),  update reflected in , hierarchical category models, AI and Consortium endpoints/models.
        -   New: Added comprehensive reporting endpoints (, , , ).

        -   New: Modified  function to accept and store .
        -   Fixes: Corrected  endpoint's parameter validation; refined  endpoint to properly accept payment amount; fixed  endpoint; addressed MongoDB  serialization error for tags endpoint.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing UI, state, API calls, and integrating various components. Serves as the application's single page.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Existing: Login fixes,  corrections, new /, updated modals for currency, integrated icons/handlers, AI/Consortium module integration,  integration for transactions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the current AI engineer was engaged in a critical phase of addressing user-reported bugs that were previously declared as fixed, specifically without consuming additional credits.

The user's latest feedback (Chat Message 149) highlighted several issues, with the top priority being the incorrect display of the hierarchical category dropdown in the Adicionar Despesa (Add Expense) modal. The AI engineer has acknowledged this critical request and has begun an investigation.

The investigation (Chat Message 155-166) involved:
1.  Searching for  in the frontend (), which yielded no direct matches, indicating the component either doesn't exist or is named differently.
2.  Broadening the search to  in the frontend, which found relevant sections in .
3.  Specifically examining the  component within  (Chat Message 161, 163, 165).
4.  The engineer confirmed that the  (around line 3454) is attempting to use a component called , which is indeed not implemented or available in the current codebase.

This confirms a functional gap that was previously reported as 100% functional by the prior engineer. The current work is precisely at the point of recognizing this discrepancy and preparing to implement the missing  component to resolve the hierarchical category dropdown issue, in line with the user's explicit request for re-fixes without additional credit consumption.

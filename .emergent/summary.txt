The AI engineer's work trajectory outlines the development of the OrçaZenFinanceiro application from an MVP state to a more feature-rich product. Initially, the focus was on the File Import System, where backend issues (MongoDB configuration, transaction creation in  endpoint) were identified and addressed. Following this, the Consórcio e Empréstimo Consignado module was fully implemented and rigorously tested on the backend. The frontend for both File Import and Consórcio/Empréstimo was then developed. A recurring authentication problem (email verification) emerged, hindering full frontend testing via UI. The Credit Cards and Invoices system underwent a comprehensive review, confirming its robust handling of multiple cards. Subsequently, PWA features, biblical/motivational messages, and the initial backend for the Pet Shop module were implemented. The most recent efforts involved debugging and fixing MongoDB  serialization errors within the newly developed Pet Shop backend. The work has progressed systematically through user-defined phases, with iterative testing and debugging.

<product_requirements>
OrçaZenFinanceiro is a Brazilian personal financial control web application aiming for comprehensive financial management. Core features include user authentication, dashboard, account management with credit card invoicing, detailed transaction handling (CRUD, BRL values, 184 hierarchical categories, AI classification, receipt upload, recurring transactions, filtering), budgeting, financial reports (cash flow, expenses/revenues by category, debt, CSV/Excel export), and notifications.

Recent additions (Phase 2 & 3) include financial goal tracking, AI Intelligent Analysis, a Consortium System, and post-handover requirements: report filters, subcategory statistics, transaction tags, a re-structured Consortium module, and a crucial File Import System (supporting .XLSX, .CSV, .PDF, .JPG/.PNG with duplication validation and preview). The Lazer category, User Profile page, and Fixed Quick Actions were successfully implemented and validated. A  import bug on the Cartões page was fixed. Current focus includes finalizing the File Import System, building the Consórcio e Empréstimo Consignado module, implementing PWA support, adding Biblical/Motivational messages, and starting the Pet Shop module.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on the Pet Shop module, which is part of Phase 3 of the application development. The backend for this module had been largely implemented, including new Pydantic models for , , and related entities, as well as auxiliary functions for statistics and CRUD API endpoints (, , , ) in .

During the initial backend testing of the Pet Shop module using , a critical  related to MongoDB  was identified (Chat Message 263). This issue prevents the proper serialization and deserialization of MongoDB's default primary key, , into JSON responses, effectively breaking the API communication for this module.

The AI engineer's most recent actions (Chat Messages 267-282) were dedicated to fixing this serialization problem across various Pet Shop endpoints in . This involved modifying the Pydantic models and FastAPI endpoint logic to correctly handle or exclude the  field when converting MongoDB documents to API responses, and also ensuring  was used for async operations. After applying these fixes, the backend services were restarted (Chat Messages 283-284), and the  file was updated to reflect these changes (Chat Messages 285-288). The current state is that the backend  serialization issues for the Pet Shop module have been addressed, and it's ready for re-testing.
